        <text>The lymphatic system, or lymphoid system, is an organ system in vertebrates that is part of the circulatory system and the immune system. It is made up of a large network of lymph, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, lymphatic or lymphoid organs, and lymphoid tissues.[1][2] The vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph 
        (the Latin word lympha refers to the deity of fresh water, "Lympha")[3] towards the heart.

        <title>Endocrine</title>
        <text>The endocrine system is a messenger system comprising feedback loops of the hormones released 
            by internal glands of an organism directly into the circulatory system, regulating distant target organs.
         In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems.

        <text>The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It is essentially the body's electrical wiring. 
          Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.

        <text>The respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. 
        It includes your airways, lungs, and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of 
        the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.

        <text>The urinary system, also known as the renal system or urinary tract, consists of the kidneys, 
          ureters, bladder, and the urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. 
          The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine.
